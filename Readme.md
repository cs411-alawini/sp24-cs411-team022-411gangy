# Table for Two

Table for Two is a web application that pairs people up to explore local restaurants together based on their unique preferences. The purpose of this project is to encourage people to go out of their comfort zone and try new cuisines while also fostering meaningful connections over lunch or dinner! Our application currently is tailored for people living in New York City and provides restaurant recommendations in the area.
