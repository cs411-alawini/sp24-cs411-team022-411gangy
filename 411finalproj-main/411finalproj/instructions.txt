1. install mysql and also mysql workbench. create the tables using the document
2. add the insert statements (optional - not needed for functionality)
3. change the sql host password etc stuff in server.js to match your local database connection
4. install all the required packages (node, express, npm, react, mysql2, (might have forgetten some))
5. create two terminals - cd one to backend and cd the other to frontend
6. 'npm run dev' in backend. should run in localhost:3000
7. 'npm start' in frontend. should run in localhost:3001 (or somewehre else - this doesnt matter as much)
8. let me know if anything else doesn't work properly lol
