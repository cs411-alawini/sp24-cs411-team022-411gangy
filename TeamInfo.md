## Project Summary

Table for Two is a web application that pairs people up to explore local restaurants together based on their unique preferences. The purpose of this project is to encourage people to go out of their comfort zone and try new cuisines while also fostering meaningful connections over lunch or dinner! Our application currently is tailored for people living in New York City and provides restaurant recommendations in the area.

When a user creates a profile, they have the option of adding what kinds of restaurants and meals they want to try. After they are matched with another user, they have the option of reserving a table for two at a restaurant that reflects their preferences. The dataset we use for this project contains information about numerous restaurants in New York City, and we plan on collecting user preference information to pair people together.
